# Verdio

Smart plant tracking and care management for modern gardeners.

Verdio is a modern web application designed to help users organize, track, and manage their plants with clarity and structure.  
It allows gardeners to monitor plant details, manage care routines, and keep their personal collection organized in a simple and intuitive interface.

Built with Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase.

This project serves both as a production-oriented application and a showcase of clean architecture and modern full-stack practices.
